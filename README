Hello DarkVoidians!

I have decided to make the NoobSpawn an open-source project so everyone may use and add what they wish to the Noob Spawn.
I will then compile everything together and add it into the original and then we can use it on the server.

Let me know what you add or post pics on the forums in the meantime. feel free to edit anything that is already
in place.

I recommend using the SSP mod version of WorldEdit or your own server if you have one.

Thanks for the help everyone and have fun with it!
